# An AI Coding Challenge

## Reflection 

1: AI quickly created the HTML layout
2: The AI-generated card forgot to show the back card when it's flipped. I fixed this at first by toggling the hidden class, then I changed the style and HTML codes instead of toggling the class.
and the .empty-state class was being applied even when the element had a hidden attribute, causing it to show simultaneously with the card content.
3: Design for mobile.
4: Add aria-label. Hidden label visually.
5: Speak with more detail to AI to improve the data.
