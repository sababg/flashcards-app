# An AI Coding Challenge

## Reflection

1: AI quickly created the HTML layout
2: It was kind of a lot issues such as functionality, clarity, clean-code and more. such as The AI-generated card forgot to show the data in the back card when it's flipped. I fixed this at first by toggling the hidden class, then I changed the style and HTML codes instead of toggling the class. and the .empty-state class was being applied even when the element had data. The css has some minor issues such as overflow in X dimension. the page scroll in Y dimension and more.
3: Design for small view. Showing the data in the back of card when card flip.
4: Add aria-label. Hidden label visually. Semantic HTML.
5: Speak with more detail to AI to improve the data. I mean you can ask AI with more detail what you want and I think it's better you know the expected codes, just ask it to make it faster and improve it, but you need to ask each part separately, I mean in each time, small part of the codes.
